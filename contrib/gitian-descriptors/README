Gavin's notes on getting gitian builds up and running:

You need the right hardware: you need a 64-bit-capable CPU with hardware virtualization support (Intel VT-x or AMD-V). Not all modern CPUs support hardware virtualization.

You probably need to enable hardware virtualization in your machine's BIOS.

You need to be running a recent version of 64-bit-Ubuntu, and you need to install several prerequisites:
  sudo apt-get install apache2 git apt-cacher-ng python-vm-builder qemu-kvm ruby

Sanity checks:
  sudo service apt-cacher-ng status   # Should return apt-cacher-ng is running
  ls -l /dev/kvm   # Should show a /dev/kvm device

Check that you have the 'kvm' group, or you won't have permissions to use kvm:
  groups    # should include 'kvm' in the list
If the group is missing:
  sudo usermod -aG kvm <your_username>    # will need to log out and back in to take effect

Once you've got the right hardware and software:

    git clone git://github.com/(user)/slimcoin.git
    git clone git://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder.git
    mkdir gitian-builder/inputs
    ## wget 'http://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/files/download.php?file=miniupnpc-1.6.tar.gz' -O gitian-builder/inputs/miniupnpc-1.6.tar.gz
    # Download all the deps and put them in the 'inputs' directory; I need to make a list of what they are
    #  but for now check the 'files' sections of the YML files to see what it looks for.

    cd gitian-builder
    bin/make-base-vm --arch i386
    bin/make-base-vm --arch amd64  # needed?
    cd ..

    # To build
    cd slimcoin
    git pull
    cd ../gitian-builder
    git pull
    ./bin/gbuild --commit slimcoin=HEAD ../slimcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian.yml
